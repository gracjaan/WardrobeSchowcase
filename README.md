## 3D product-based website

This website focuses on 3D product presentation, namely t-shirt. It starts on landing page showcasing the product. When 'Customize it' button is clicked, user is rerouted to customizable screen. There he/she can play with the t-shirt by chanigng color and texture. There is also AI tool implemented in case user seeks for inspiration. I coded this website mainly to learn threejs but it went beyond my expectations so I even developed AI feature. If I had to point out the most difficult part of this project, it would be setting up a scene in three.js - it really took me a while. Surprisngly, AI feature was not that hard to implement.
